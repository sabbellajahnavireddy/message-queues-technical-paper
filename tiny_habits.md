# Tiny_Habits

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- One idea from the video that really stood out to me was how small, “tiny” habits — even those that take only a few seconds can lead to major change over time, especially when anchored to existing routines. The fact that BJ Fogg recommends starting with a habit so small that “it’s almost silly” is powerful, it removes the friction and resistance we usually face when trying to change behaviour. 

- I also found the concept of using a trigger or prompt — an action you already do regularly — to “anchor” a new tiny habit very clever. For example: “after I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth” or “after I pee, I will do two push-ups”. This method practically automates habit formation by leveraging what’s already in your daily routine. 

- Finally, the idea that every tiny success should be celebrated — no matter how small — resonated a lot. That celebration helps reinforce positive habit formation, turning small actions into automatic behavior over time. 

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- **What is B = MAP**
- B = MAP is a simple model that says: a Behavior (B) — like a habit — happens when three things converge at the same moment: Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P). 
- If any of these three elements is missing (or too weak), the behavior is unlikely to happen.

- **What do M, A, and P stand for**

- M — Motivation: how much you want to do the behavior. Your interest, desire, emotional urge, or perceived benefit. 
- A — Ability: how easy or doable the behavior is. If a task is simple — quick, low effort, low mental load — ability is high. 
- P — Prompt: the cue or trigger that makes you do the behavior at a certain time. Could be a reminder, a signal, something in your environment — anything that “nudges” you.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit).
1. Celebration helps your brain remember the habit.
- When you celebrate, you create a small positive emotion. This emotion tells your brain, “This action is good, keep doing it.”
2. It gives a dopamine boost that strengthens the habit.
- Dopamine acts like a reward signal. When your brain gets it, the habit becomes easier to repeat the next time.
3. Celebration builds confidence and makes you feel successful.
- Even small wins feel important. When you feel successful, you naturally want to continue the habit again.
4. It reduces the need for strong motivation.
- Motivation goes up and down, but celebrating makes the habit feel enjoyable, so you don’t rely only on mood or willpower.
5. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit faster.
- The brain pays attention to what feels good. So when you shine after a habit, your brain treats it as something important and sticks to it.

## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- **It shows that big transformations don’t need big actions** sometimes the smallest details matter more. The idea that 1% improvements may seem insignificant in isolation, but over time they multiply into major success, feels empowering.

- **It redefines “progress.”** Instead of chasing dramatic overnight change (which often fails), it emphasizes steady, consistent improvement. This makes change feel realistic and achievable — not overwhelming.

- **It applies everywhere:** your health, work, learning, relationships — the same principle works. It’s universal and practical.

- **It challenges the “all or nothing” mindset.** Many people feel discouraged because they can’t commit to big goals. This story shows: even if you only manage small wins, they matter. Over time they build into something big.

- **It values attention to details.** Sometimes we ignore small habits or small decisions because they feel trivial. But this demonstrates small things do matter — often more than we think.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- According to Atomic Habits, your habits are not just isolated actions they are reflections of who you believe you are. 
- Identity is not fixed. Instead of seeing identity as something given, Clear argues identity emerges from your repeated habits over time. 
- In other words: “Your identity is literally your repeated beingness.”

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
- The book explains that if you want a habit to stick, you must make it simple, smooth, and effortless.
James Clear calls this the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: “Make it Easy.”

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
- To break a bad habit (or reduce an unwanted behavior), the book says you must add friction, increase difficulty, and remove triggers. When a behavior becomes inconvenient, you naturally stop doing it.
1. Increase friction → add steps between you and the bad habit
- The more steps, time, or effort required, the less likely you will do it.
2. Make the habit impossible to start immediately
- Atomic Habits teaches that stopping the first step often stops the whole behavior.
3. Change your environment so the habit doesn’t get triggered
- The book explains that environment controls behavior. A bad habit is easier to avoid when the cues are removed.
4. Use a “commitment device” to lock in better behavior
- A commitment device is a smart choice you make now that restricts your options later.
5. Increase the cost of doing the bad habit
- When a habit becomes socially, emotionally, or financially expensive, you avoid it.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

1. Make the Cue Obvious
- Keep the book on my bed or desk where I can see it easily.
Use habit stacking: “After I brush my teeth, I will read for 10 minutes.”

2. Make the Habit Attractive
- Choose books I enjoy so I look forward to reading.
Make it part of a relaxing routine like tea + reading.

3. Make the Action Easy
- Start with just 2 minutes or 1 page.
Keep the book open to the page I left so I can begin instantly.

4. Make the Response Satisfying
- Celebrate after finishing by saying “Good job!”
Mark a tick on a calendar to feel progress and success.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

1. Make the cue invisible
- I will keep my phone in another room after 9 PM.
Out of sight means I won’t get tempted to pick it up.

2. Make the habit unattractive
- I will remind myself how late-night scrolling makes me tired the next morning.
Linking the habit with a negative feeling reduces the desire.

3. Make the process hard
- I will log out of social media apps and turn off Wi-Fi at night.
Adding extra steps makes it less convenient to use my phone.

4. Make the response unsatisfying
- I will track every day I break the rule and lose a point on my habit chart.
Seeing this loss makes the behavior less rewarding.
