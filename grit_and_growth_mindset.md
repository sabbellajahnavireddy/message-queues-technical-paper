## 3. What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?
- Internal Locus of Control refers to the belief that you — your own choices, efforts and actions — are the main factors determining what happens in your life. 

- People with internal locus tend to feel responsible for their successes and failures. They see outcomes as contingent on what they do, rather than on luck, fate, or outside forces. 

- This belief gives them a sense of personal agency — a feeling that they have control and can influence events through their actions. 

##### Key Point from the Video

- The video argues that adopting an internal locus of control is vital for maintaining motivation. 
- When you believe that your actions matter that success or failure hinges on what you do — you’re more likely to stay motivated, keep working toward goals, and persevere even when facing difficulties. 
- By contrast, if you believe external factors (luck, fate, external events) control everything, you may feel powerless  which reduces motivation and can lead to giving up more easily.
